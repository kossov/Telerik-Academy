            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Backgammon is one of the oldest board games for two players. The playing pieces are moved
            according to the roll of
            dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. Backgammon is a member
            of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.

            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice
            may determine the outcome
            of a single game, over a series of many games, the better player will accumulate the better record. Thus, records of
            matches between players are good indicators of relative skill. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from
            numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. In variants that
            originate from early 20th century New York, players may raise the stakes during the game. There is an established
            repertoire of common tactics and occurrences.
